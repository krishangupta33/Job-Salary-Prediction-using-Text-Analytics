"Find ****’s of vacancies like this on the sectors only free dedicated iPhone and Android application. iPhone http://tinyurl.com/AppleOptometry Android http://tinyurl.com/AndroidOptometryapp Company Prospect Health’s Optical Division is currently working on behalf of a successful practice that is looking to recruit a high calibre optometrist to become a pivotal part of the team. In return you can expect a rewarding role with a fantastic amount of support and a genuinely marketleading career development programme. The practice is run as an independent firm with all of the key decisions made by the director and their team at a local level, unlike multiples where decision making processes are generally devolved to a central board of directors that doesn’t have a clue what’s going on at a local level; As an optometrist you would be a key part of the store management team and have a real say in how the business is run; There aren’t multiple layers of management interfering with things and getting in the way; If there’s a problem it can be fixed quickly; Likewise, if someone has a good idea it can be implemented quickly. The whole set up is geared towards people getting much more job satisfaction than you’d get in most other firms. Also the wider group is growing more quickly than anyone else, which means they can offer more opportunities for career growth than anyone else. This is especially true in the current economic climate because where some firms are reporting drops of 1020% in business levels and making redundancies and cutting working hours. This business is bucking the trend and continuing to show growth per store right across the board. It’s probably also worth mentioning that not one of their practices has ever gone out of business. There aren’t really any other firms out there that can offer such a good mix of independence and support. Practice This particular practice is growing extremely quickly in the area following the continual success they are managing to achieve. They are situated in area that is very easy to commute by car and there is free parking nearby as well. If you don’t happen to drive, the local train station is also just a short walk away. Inside the practice it is extremely modern being newly built just a few years ago and will provide a bright airy enjoyable facility in which to work. They have three test rooms all fully equipped with superb modern equipment and you will also feel reassured knowing you are fully supported by an excellent team of fully trained professionals. Role Working closely with the directors of the business, your ideas and opinions can be heard and acted upon at short notice. As an optometrist with this business you have the chance to develop your skills both clinically and commercially, working with other qualified colleagues and sharing your experiences on a daily basis. You won’t be just a number, you won’t have to jump through hoops or deal with masses of red tape to get things done. You would need to have good customer service skills and rapport building. This is the kind of environment where you can have a say in how the business is run and feel the kind of autonomy and flexibility most employees dream about. Your main responsibilities will be to provide an excellent standard of clinical care whilst also helping to develop the business as much as possible. You will not be required to work Sundays but Saturdays are something of a must. As you will be working so closely with the management team, your ideas will be readily received allowing you to ensure the company is operating in line with your expectations for patient care. You will need to be able to test efficiently and effectively and will receive a high level of support to ensure you are able to use your professional skills to their maximum effect. Training & Development As you would expect, the career development and professional training programme is superb, genuinely marketleading. Our client can offer perhaps the most structured career path out there. The director is keen to develop the skill set of its entire staff and encourages career development within the practice which could even lead to a Joint Venture Partnership. They recognise excellence and reward their staff extremely well for outstanding achievement. Remuneration & benefits Package You can expect a very competitive salary package which rewards high performance and those who exceed the expectations placed upon them. A lucrative bonus scheme is therefore a given alongside a company pension scheme. Summary In summary this is a fantastic opportunity to operate in an environment where ideas are heard and your skills, experience and creativity can impact the business directly on a daily basis. Whilst working for one of the UK’s leading optical brands you will be part of an independentlymanaged opticians business that benefits from unrivalled levels of head office support and offers you careerdefining training and development.
