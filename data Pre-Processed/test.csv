"**** Stone Buildings Graduate employer profile **** Stone Buildings Graduate jobs and schemes RSS Pupillage Home Graduate jobs Jobs Graduate scheme at **** Stone Buildings  Pupillage We aim to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and practical experience they need for a successful career at the Bar. We believe that it is important for all pupils to see as much as possible of the different kinds of work in Chambers. This enables pupils to judge whether our work suits them, and enables different members of Chambers to assess the pupils. Each pupil therefore normally spends time with three or more pupil supervisors within any twelvemonth period. If other members of Chambers have particularly interesting cases in Court, pupils will be encouraged to work and attend Court with them. All pupils work in their pupil supervisors rooms, read their papers, attend their conferences, draft pleadings and documents, write draft opinions and accompany their pupil supervisors to Court. Pupils are treated as part of Chambers and are fully involved in the activities of Chambers while they are with us. What we look for Candidates are expected to have first class or good second class degrees. But mere intellectual ability is only part of it: a successful candidate must have the confidence and ambition to succeed, the common sense to recognise the practical advice a client really needs, and an ability to get on well with clients, solicitors and other members of Chambers and the clerks.
